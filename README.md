# Meetings Addon

A browser extension that parses meeting information from [Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY](https://wol.jw.org/) and outputs the data as JSON for easy consumption by other apps—particularly my companion project, [meeting-manager](https://github.com/elvisoliveira/meeting-manager).

This project is for my personal use to streamline midweek meeting assignments. **This is purely a hobby project with no commercial intent.** If this project inadvertently infringes any rights or offends anyone, please contact me and I will gladly remove or adjust the repository.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the [Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY](https://wol.jw.org/) site where meeting information is presented.
2. The extension will parse the relevant data in the background.
3. **Click** the extension icon in your browser’s toolbar to see and/or copy the JSON output.
4. This JSON output can be integrated into any application, but it’s primarily designed for use with [meeting-manager](https://github.com/elvisoliveira/meeting-manager).
